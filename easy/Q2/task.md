# Product Details Display System

## Problem Title
Product Details Display Using JavaScript Object and DOM Manipulation

---

## Problem Description
The Product Details Display System is a simple front-end application that demonstrates how product information can be stored using a JavaScript object and displayed dynamically on a web page. The application presents essential product details such as product name, price, and stock availability in a visually appealing card layout.

The system uses object properties to manage product data and updates the user interface dynamically. It also provides user interaction through a button to confirm product availability.

## Input
- No direct user data input is required
- Product information is predefined within the application
- User interaction occurs through a button click

---

### Application Structure
1. **Product Card Interface**
   - Displays product title
   - Shows product price
   - Indicates stock availability

2. **Data Handling**
   - Product details are stored in a single object
   - Object properties are accessed to update the UI

3. **Dynamic Display**
   - Product title and price are shown dynamically
   - Stock status changes based on availability

4. **User Interaction**
   - A button allows the user to view product status
   - A message is shown based on stock availability

---

## Explanation
- The application uses an object literal to represent a product
- Dot notation is used to access object properties
- DOM manipulation updates content without reloading the page
- Conditional logic determines stock status display
- Visual feedback improves user understanding

---

## Constraints
- Product data is static and predefined
- No backend or database integration
- Single product supported
- Stock status is boolean-based
- No persistent storage after page reload
- Designed for learning object handling and DOM concepts
